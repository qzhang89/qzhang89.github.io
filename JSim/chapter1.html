        <h2>Time-independent Schrödinger equation</h2>

        <p>The time-independent Schrödinger equation for an elementary particle in three dimensions is:</p>
           \[ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V(\vec{r}) \psi = E \psi \]
        <p>where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant, \( m \) is the mass of the particle, \( V \) is
           the potential energy, \( E \) is the energy of the particle, and \( \psi \) is the wave function.</p>

        <p>For simplicity, we assume that the space is one-dimensional. The time-independent Schrödinger
           equation then becomes:</p>
           \[ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + V(x) \psi = E \psi \]

        <p>Here, we will solve this ordinary differential equation numerically. We discretize space in steps of
           size \( \Delta x \). The second derivative in the equation above can be written in the finite-difference
           form:</p>
           \[ \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} \approx \frac{\psi_{i+1} - 2\psi_i + \psi_{i-1}}{(\Delta x)^2} \]

        <p>where \( \psi_i = \psi (x_0 + i \Delta x) \). Substituting this into the time-independent Schrödinger
           equation, we have:</p>
           \[ \psi_{i+1} = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} (V_i - E) (\Delta x)^2 \psi_i + 2\psi_i - \psi_{i-1} \]

        <p>This is a simple recursion, from which we can easily obtain \( \psi_2,\,\psi_3,\,\ldots,\,\psi_{N-1}
           \) (where \( N \) is the total number of grid points) if \( \psi_0 \) and \( \psi_1 \) are initialized.</p>

        <h2>Constant potential: Plane waves</h2>

        <p>First of all, we must know the potential distribution that the particle experiences in. Let's first
           consider the simplest case: A constant potential.</p>
           \[ V(x) = 0 \]

        <p>Let's try to work this problem out and see what result we will obtain. The recursion now becomes:</p>
           \[ \psi_{i+1} = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} (0 - E) (\Delta x)^2 \psi_i + 2\psi_i - \psi_{i-1} \]

        <p>For convenience, we employ units in which \( \hbar = 1 \), \( m = 1 \). We take \( \psi_0 = 1.0 \)
           and \( \psi_1 = 1.0 \) as initial conditions to obtain \( \psi_2,\,\psi_3,\,\ldots,\,\psi_{N-1} \). In
           this problem, \( x_0 = -2.5 \), \( x_{N-1} = 2.5 \) and \( \Delta x = 0.001 \).</p>

        <p>The energy of the particle \( E \) is an unknown. Choosing different values of \( E \) will result in
           different shapes of the wave function. As illustrated in the simulations below, the solutions are simply
           plane waves. The energy difference between \( E \) (<span style="color: rgb(220, 0, 220);">purple</span>
           line) and \( V = 0 \) (<span style="color: rgb(0, 220, 0);">green</span> line) determines the frequency
           of the plane wave, which agrees with our expectation: the higher energy of the particle, the stronger
           oscillation of the wave function. (the wave functions in the plot are properly scaled for better
           plotting)</p>

        <div class="shootManu" style="float: none; margin: auto;">
        { "xMin":-2.5, "xMax":2.5, "dx":0.001, "VType":0, "EMin":0, "EMax":60,
          "cw":0.90, "ch":0.75, "xRange":[-2.5, 2.5], "yRange":[-2, 65] }
        </div>

        <h2>Linear potential: Airy functions</h2>

        <p>Constant potential was simple enough. Let see what will happen if we change our potential a little
           bit: a linear potential.</p>
           \[ V(x) = kx + b \]

        <p>The procedure for solving this problem is identical to the one for solving the constant potential
           problem except we have different potential distributions. We employ units in which \( \hbar = 1 \), \( m
           = 1 \), \( k = -20 \) and \( b = 15 \). We take \( \psi_0 = 1.0 \) and \( \psi_1 = 1.0 \) as initial
           conditions to obtain \( \psi_2,\,\psi_3,\,\ldots,\,\psi_{N-1} \). In this problem, \( x_0 = -2.5 \), \(
           x_{N-1} = 2.5 \) and \( \Delta x = 0.001 \).</p>

        <p>The resulting solutions are called the Airy functions. One interesting property is that their shapes
           are independent of \( E \), as you might expect from the symmetry point of view. The wave functions
           vanish in the left region, because the energy of the particle is lower than the potential and hence the
           particle cannot penetrate into this region. Nevertheless, we still see some "tail" in this classical
           forbidden region. That is the so called tunnelling effect in quantum mechanics.</p>

        <div class="shootManu" style="float: none; margin: auto;">
        { "xMin":-2.5, "xMax":2.5, "dx":0.001, "VType":1, "EMin":0, "EMax":60,
          "cw":0.90, "ch":0.75, "xRange":[-2.5, 2.5], "yRange":[-2, 65] }
        </div>

        <p>However, the wave functions in the previous two examples are not normalizable. The wave functions extend
           into infinity. They are called the <strong>scatterd</strong> solutions, as the potential cannot "trap"
           the particles. In this case, the particle can take any positive energy.</p>

        <p>In the examples below, we will study the <strong>bounded</strong> solutions, which require potential
           "wells" to trap the particles. For bounded solutions, the particle cannot take arbitrary energy anymore.
           They must satisfy the boundary condition, thus discrete solutions arise.</p>

        <h2>Infinite potential well (Particle-in-a-box)</h2>

        <p>As the first example of a potential "well", let's first consider the simplest case: Particle-in-a-box
           problem. We assume that the potential is \( V = 0 \) inside the box and \( V = \infty \) outside the
           box:</p>
           \[
           V(x) = \left\{
           \begin{array}{rl}
           0 &amp; \text{if } |x| \lt L,\\
           \infty &amp; \text{if } |x| \ge L. \ \text{numerically we take } 1000
           \end{array} \right.
           \]

        <p>This is one famous quantum mechanics problem that can be solved analytically. Here we will use the
           shooting method to solve this problem numerically. Again, choosing different values of \( E \) will
           result in different shapes of the wave function. But only a set of precisely discrete values of \( E \)
           can lead the wave functions to be normalizable. All of the other values of \( E \) will lead the wave
           functions to diverge to \( + \infty \) or \( - \infty \) at larger \( x \), which are not allowed wave
           functions for our particle. Those precisely discrete energy values are called the <strong>eigen-engeries</strong>
           and the corresponding wave functions are called the <strong>eigen-functions</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>We obtain the eigen-energy by trial-and-error so that the wave function vanishes at the two ends.
           This approach for solving a differential equation that has boundary conditions that must be satisfied at
           both ends of an interval is known as the shooting method. This method is analogous to trying to throw a
           basketball into a basket with a proper initial velocity.</p>

        <div class="shootManu">
        { "xMin":-1.5, "xMax":1.5, "dx":0.001, "VType":2, "EMin":0, "EMax":60,
          "cw":0.90, "ch":0.75, "xRange":[-2.5, 2.5], "yRange":[-2, 65] }

        </div>

        <h2>Harmonic oscillator</h2>

        <p>In classical mechanics, harmonic oscillator is a mass \( m \) attached to a spring of force constant
           \( k \). The motion is governed by Hooke's law:</p>
           \[ F = -kx = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} \]

        <p>The potential energy of the harmonic oscillator is:</p>
           \[ V(x) = \frac{1}{2} kx^2 = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 \]
        <p>where \( \omega \equiv \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) is the angular frequency of oscillation.</p>

        <p>In quantum mechanics, the harmoic oscillator problem is to solve the Schrödinger equation with this
           potential. The time-independent Schrödinger equation leads to:</p>
           \[ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 \psi = E \psi \]

        <p>The harmonic oscillator problem is also a well known quantum mechanics problem that can be solved
           analytically. The exact value of eigen-energies obtained from analytical solution is given by \( E_n =
           (n + \frac{1}{2}) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = 0,\,1,\,2,\,\ldots \). The eigen-energies are
           distributed uniformly with a energy gap \( \hbar \omega \) (in this example \( \hbar \omega = 5 \)). We
           can easily compare our numerical results with the exact solutions from the belowing simulations.</p>

        <div class="shootManu">
        { "xMin":-2.0, "xMax":2.0, "dx":0.001, "VType":3, "EMin":0, "EMax":60,
          "cw":0.90, "ch":0.75, "xRange":[-2.5, 2.5], "yRange":[-2, 65] }
        </div>

        <div class="shootAuto">
        { "xMin":-2.0, "xMax":2.0, "dx":0.001, "VType":3, "lLim":0.0, "uLim":60.0,
          "cw":0.90, "ch":0.75, "xRange":[-2.5, 2.5], "yRange":[-2, 65] }
        </div>

        <h2>W-shape potential well (Quartic potential)</h2>

        <p>In the previous two examples, we solved the eigen-energy eigen-function problem of the infinite
           potential well and the harmonic oscillator numerically. Analytical solutions are well known for these
           two problems. Thus, we can easily compare our numerical solutions with those exact solutions. This
           approach is called confirmative analysis, which means we confirm the correctness of our numercial
           methods by comparing the simulated results with the exact solutions.</p>

        <p>There are only a few problems in quantum mechanics that can be solved exactly. Nearly all the
           nontrivial quantum mechanics problems either have no known analytical solutions or can be attacked
           analytically only with extreme difficulty. That is why numerical methods play an important role in the
           study of quantum mechanics problems. In this example, we switch our confirmative analysis into
           explorative analysis. We consider a "W-shape" potential well, namely, a quartic potential.</p>

        <p>The quartic potential distribution is given by the following expression:</p>
           \[ V(x) = 30 x^4 + \alpha x^2 \]
        <p>where \( \alpha \in [-50,\ 10] \) is adjustable in the slider under the belowing graphs.</p>

        <div class="shootManu">
        { "xMin":-2.0, "xMax":2.0, "dx":0.001, "VType":4, "EMin":-20, "EMax":50,
          "cw":0.90, "ch":0.75, "xRange":[-2.5, 2.5], "yRange":[-23, 55] }
        </div>

        <div class="shootAuto">
        { "xMin":-2.0, "xMax":2.0, "dx":0.001, "VType":4, "lLim":-20.0, "uLim":50.0,
          "cw":0.90, "ch":0.75, "xRange":[-2.5, 2.5], "yRange":[-23, 55] }
        </div>

        <p>We can choose any potential distribution we are interested in and obtain the simulation results.</p>
