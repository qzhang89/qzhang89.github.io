  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \small
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We implemented Numerov's method with logarithmic grid to solve
    the \emph{one-electron} problem and obtained very accurate solutions.
    \item We solved the many-electron problem using \emph{self-consistent field} approximation.
    \item Based on SCF calculation, we constructed atomic \emph{multiplet states},
    which are the many-electron eigen-states in atoms.
    \item Finally we introduced the \emph{spin-orbit coupling}, where we see the
    spectral lines further split into finer structures.
  \end{enumerate}
