\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I am heartily thankful to my supervisor, Prof.\ Dr.\ Erik Koch,
for his guidance, encouragement and support throughout my entire
thesis. He was always so patient to answer my frequent questions
and guided me to think and solve problems systematically.
I also would like to thank Dr.\ Hermann Ulm who promised me that
I can ask him any question. He helped me a lot in understanding
many detailed problems and gave me very strong encouragement through my thesis.
I am grateful to German Research School for Simulation Sciences for
providing me this great opportunity of doing my master thesis.
I am also thankful to Dr.\ Hunter Sims, Khaldoon Ghanem and Michael Baumg\"{a}rtel
for their many different helps during my thesis period.
In the end, I want to express my many thanks to Cica Gustiani, Rodrigo Canales
and Thu Hoai for our best memories studying and working together.
