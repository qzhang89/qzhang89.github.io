\chapter*{Abstract}

The goal of this thesis is to develop a simulation tool for the calculation
and visualization of the multiplet structure of all atoms across the periodic
table. The starting point are self-consistent calculations in the spherical-potential
approximation. For the resulting atomic levels we calculate the ab-initio
Slater parameters that define the electron-electron repulsion term of the
many-body Hamiltonian. We then construct the eigen-states of the Hamiltonian
on an open shell by constructing the multiplet states using the angular momentum
ladder operators and, where necessary, seniority. Finally, we include spin-orbit
coupling, using the ab-initio coupling constants determined from the self-consistent
radial potentials.
